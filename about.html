    <!-- <p>Greetings! Iâ€™m a photographer and designer currently based in Ann Arbor. 
        I shoot a wide variety of subjects, but my focus is on capturing people and 
        moments utilizing clean compositions and natural light. 
    </p> -->

    <p>
        Top o' the mornin' (or afternoon or evenin') to ya!
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm a photographer and designer based in Ann Arbor, MI. Currently a senior in the 
        University of Michigan's School of Information, I'm majoring in information, concentrating 
        on UX design and minoring in art and design. I have always worn many hats, artistically 
        speaking, but I consider myself first and foremost a photographer and designer.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a photographer I shoot a wide variety of subjects, but my focus is on capturing people 
        and moments utilizing clean compositions and natural light. I've played around with just 
        about every artistic medium out there, but the way a photo can tell a story/moment/feeling 
        pulls me back again and again. I'm also starting to dip my toes into the oh-so-exciting videography world 
        - stay tuned for my upcoming debut.
    </p>
